Hello! I want to introduce this project. Two people on one account have been working on this.

We initially made this plugin to teach ourselves how to develop with Java, which has gone very well lately. Our code has no reason to be private, and looking over old code to see how we've improved over time would be fantastic. We will attempt to leave in step by step notes in our code to help out any people trying to learn though.
